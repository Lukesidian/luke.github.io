    <p>Differences Between the Fedner Stratocaster and Fender Telecaster</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>1. Bridge</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The Strat has a floating bridge, meaning the pitch of a note can be manipulated using the tremolo bar.</p>
    <p>The Tele has a set bridge, meaning there is no ability to manipulate pitch with the bridge after the note is played.</p>
