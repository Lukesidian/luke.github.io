    <p>From ‘Goodfellas’ to ‘Flower Moon’: How Scorsese Has Rethought Violence</p>

    <p>The director was long identified with ornately edited set pieces. In “The Irishman” and his latest</p>
    <p>film, the flourishes have given way to blunt truths.</p>

    <p>Of all the haunting images and disturbing sounds that permeate Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the</p>
    <p>Flower Moon,” none is more upsetting than the guttural cry from Mollie Burkhart (Lily</p>
    <p>Gladstone), a tortured wail of rage and grief that escapes her reserved visage when tragedy</p>
    <p>strikes. And it often does: “Killers” tells the true story, adapted from the book by David Grann,</p>
    <p>of how Mollie’s Osage community was decimated by murderous white men, who killed dozens</p>
    <p>of her tribe members for rights to their oil-rich land.</p>
    <p>Mollie’s howl of pain is not quite like any sound heard before in a Scorsese film. But in many</p>
    <p>ways, Scorsese is emulating her jarring cry in the ominous aesthetics of “Killers of the Flower</p>
    <p>Moon” itself, and of his 2019 feature, “The Irishman.”</p>
